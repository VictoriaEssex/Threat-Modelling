# Python Attack Tree

## Project Brief

Create a python application that allows you to both visualise the attack tree/ graph AND to add values to the nodes which the application will aggregate to form an overall value impact to the business of any of the threats identified. 

## Criteria

1. User needs to add values 
2. Demonstrate both pre and post digitilisation 

## Libraries

If you do not have Python installed, please visit https://www.python.org/ and follow the download instructions.

Install the following library: networkx
Please use the command "pip install network" in the terminal


## Run

Git clone the following repository 

and then run the code to visualise the attack tree.

## Testing 

Pylint
